#  Cellutionz Price Elasticity & Optimization

This project analyzes historical sales and pricing data from Cellutionz, a mobile device repair business, to estimate price elasticity and optimize pricing strategies using Python and pyGAM.

##  Project Overview

Cellutionz offers repair services for iPhone devices, including:
- iPhone 14 Pro Max & iPhone 14 Pro screen repairs
- LCD repair
- Battery replacement
- Charging port repair

Each service is offered with either **original** or **aftermarket** parts. This analysis uses weekly sales data across 2024, including special events like:
- **Black Friday**
- **Cyber Monday**
- **Christmas Week**

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- pyGAM for Generalized Additive Modeling
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Features
- Load and explore structured CSV data of weekly sales
- Visualize relationships between price and quantity sold
- Apply pyGAM to model non-linear demand curves
- Estimate **price elasticity of demand**
- Determine optimal prices to maximize revenue

## üìÅ Files
- `Cellutionz_Pricing_Data.csv`: Simulated repair service sales data for 2024
- `Cellutionz_Price_Elasticity_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for analysis
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

##  Future Improvements
- Add cost data to compute **profit-maximizing prices**
- Extend elasticity modeling to all product categories
- Integrate promotional campaign analysis (e.g., bundle pricing)

##  How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment
3. Install `pyGAM` if needed: `pip install pygam`
4. Run the cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis
